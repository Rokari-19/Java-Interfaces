/*
 * 1. Class Definition:
 * 
 * public class Main { ... }: This line declares a public class named Main. In
 * Java, classes are blueprints for creating objects, which encapsulate data
 * (properties) and behavior (methods). Public means this class can be accessed
 * from other code in your project.
 * 2. Main Method:
 * 
 * public static void main(String[] args) { ... }: This is the entry point of
 * the program. When you run the Java code, the main method is the first thing
 * that gets executed.
 * public: This indicates that the main method can also be accessed from other
 * code.
 * static: This means the method belongs to the class itself, not any objects
 * created from the class.
 * void: This signifies that the main method doesn't return any value.
 * String[] args: This is an array of strings that can be used to pass
 * command-line arguments to the program when it's run. In this example, it's
 * not being used.
 * 3. Creating a Computer Object:
 * 
 * Computer hp = new Computer(new Ram(), new Processor(), new Storage());: This
 * line creates a new object of the Computer class (which we'll assume is
 * defined elsewhere) and assigns it to the variable hp.
 * new Computer(...): The new keyword is used to create a new instance of an
 * object.
 * Computer: This is the name of the class we're creating an object of.
 * (new Ram(), new Processor(), new Storage()): These are arguments being passed
 * to the constructor (a special method that gets called when creating a new
 * object) of the Computer class. We can assume these arguments are creating
 * instances of inner classes Ram, Processor, and Storage (likely representing
 * the computer's RAM, processor, and storage components), but without seeing
 * the definitions of those classes, we can't know for sure what data they hold.
 * 4. Printing the Computer Object:
 * 
 * System.out.println(hp);: This line attempts to print the value of the hp
 * variable. However, for the output to be meaningful, the Computer class likely
 * needs a toString method that specifies how a Computer object should be
 * represented as a string. Without a toString method, you might just see the
 * default object reference printed.
 * In essence, this code snippet creates a Computer object, but without seeing
 * the definitions of the Ram, Processor, and Storage classes, and the toString
 * method in the Computer class, we can't understand exactly how the computer's
 * components are being modeled or what information would be printed about the
 * hp object.
